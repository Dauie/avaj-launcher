# avaj-launcher

A simple java project meant to introduce myself to the world of java.
The goal of this project was to implement a "Simulator" based upon a given UML diagram.
It takes a sceneario file, which describes the amount of simulations, and a list of aircrafts with thier ids and coordinates. The "Simulation" then chooses a random weather for the coordinate of each aircraft, and the craft will move accorindly.

Nice and easy, but long enough to give you a small taste of Java and its syntax.
